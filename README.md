# HawaiiEruptionCameras
This code is a method for storing and sharing images from various web-cameras recording key points of Kilauea and the Lower East Rift Zone. The program accounts for cameras having different update intervals and attempts to pull all images without many duplicates. All entries are stored locally and then uploaded into a Dropbox repository. Dropbox upload code is taken from @Keshava11 and modified to work for recording dozens of different images. Camera sources are primarily USGS-HVO, all images are publicly available. Using this code yourself requires some edits to include your Dropbox access token and you will have to setup the directory structure in Dropbox to match the structure that the program expects. Local directory structure will be generated automatically when program is executed. 

Program only works on Python 3.5+.
